# DDoS Attack Analysis

## Purpose of This Study

This study aims to analyze and model Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks using the CIC-DDoS2019 dataset. By performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing, we seek to identify key patterns that differentiate normal traffic from malicious DDoS activity. Our approach includes data cleaning, handling class imbalances, and transforming skewed variables to improve model accuracy and interpretability.

## Future Work

In the next phase of this project, we will develop predictive models, with a primary focus on logistic regression to classify network traffic as benign or DDoS-related. We will also explore alternative machine learning techniques such as decision trees and support vector machines to enhance detection accuracy. Through feature selection and model tuning, we aim to optimize performance while ensuring robustness against false positives and negatives. The findings from this study will contribute to better understanding DDoS attack patterns and developing mitigation strategies to enhance cybersecurity defenses.
